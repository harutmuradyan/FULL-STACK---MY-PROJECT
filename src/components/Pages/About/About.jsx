                    here are many variations of passages 
                    of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority 
                    have suffered alteration in some form, by 
                    injected humour, or randomised words which 
                    don't look even slightly believable. If you 
                    are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, 
                    you need to be sure there isn't anything 
                    embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
                    All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet 
                    tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, 
                    making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
                    It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, 
                    combined with a handful of model sentence structures, 
                    to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. 
                    The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always 
                    free from repetition, injected humour, 
                    or non-characteristic words etc.
